This is a tiny script that automates grabbing audio CDs from a CD-ROM
drive via recording to mp3 using the sound card. I needed this as an
alternative to convert some audio book for my portable player, in a
situation where cdparanoia and thelike failed to read the CD.

The script depends on lame for encoding as well as cdda-player (from
libcdio-utils).  Be shure to set the sound card mixer paths correctly
and adjust levels prior to start grabbing.

The script is licensed under GPL v3.
